# Assignment 4: Implement Binary Search Tree: Submit to canvas

## Description

You are to implement the functions that have been "stubbed out" in
bst.c. You will also need to define data types in bst.h. Basically, you
are to implement a all of the needed Binary search Tree (BST) functions
such that main.c will work properly when linked to your bst.o.

You are given a main() program, a Makefile, and some starter code. All
you need to do is complete the actual code for the functions in bst.c
and make any changes needed to bst.h.

## How to Get Started

The starter code is publicly available on GitHub. You can clone it using
git via the following command:

> git clone https://github.com/angrynarwhal/cs3050fs2024a4

I recommend you clone this code somewhere under your home directory on
tc.rnet.missouri.edu. You are welcome to clone this and work on your
code on any platform you like. However, you should be aware that
submissions will **[[only]{.underline}]{.mark}** be evaluated by the TAs
on tc.rnet.missouri.edu. If, for example, something works on your
machine but doesn't compile on tc.rnet.missouri.edu, you will get a
zero.

Once you have cloned things down, you should cd to the newly cloned
directory and type "make". This will build the code and leave you with
an executable file called "mybst".

## Notes

-   You should not need to change any of the files except bst.c and
    bst.h. When you have completed the assignment, submit both bst.c and
    bst.h on Canvas. The TAs will clone fresh starter code down and copy
    in your bst.c and bst.h in order to evaluate it.

-   You will probably want to uncomment and possibly add code to print
    things out in main() while you are working on the assignment, but
    you should make sure your code works with the original main.c before
    you submit it.
